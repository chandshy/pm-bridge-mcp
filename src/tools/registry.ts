/**
 * Central registry for all per-category tool modules.

 * ListTools output order is load-bearing — it affects client-side system

 * src/index.ts prior to the split:
 *
 *   Sending → Reading(early) → Folders → Actions → Deletion → Analytics →
 *   System → Bridge → Aliases → Pass → Drafts → Reading(late) → Escalation
 *
 * The reading module exposes its defs as two ordered arrays
 * (`defsEarly` / `defsLate`) so this registry can splice them into the
 * historically-correct positions.
