## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **30 tools** (up from 20 in v1.0.0) with structured output and MCP annotations
- **Permission system** with 4 presets: read_only (default), supervised, send_only, full
- **Per-tool rate limiting** with configurable limits per preset
- **Human-gated escalation system** — two-channel design with CSRF protection, 5-minute expiry, audit trail
- **Browser-based settings UI** at localhost:8765 with setup wizard, permissions, escalations, and status tabs
- **Terminal UI (TUI)** with auto-detection of environment capabilities
- **MCP Resources** — `email://` and `folder://` URI schemes for addressable data
- **MCP Prompts** — compose_reply, thread_summary, find_subscriptions workflow templates
- **Cursor-based pagination** for stable pagination across mailbox mutations
- **Progress notifications** for bulk operations (bulk_move, bulk_delete, bulk_move_to_label)
- **Tool annotations** — readOnlyHint, destructiveHint, idempotentHint on all tools

#### New Tools
- `get_unread_count` — fast per-folder unread count without fetching emails
- `reply_to_email` — threaded replies with proper In-Reply-To/References headers
- `archive_email` — convenience wrapper to move to Archive
- `move_to_label` — move email to Labels/ folder
- `bulk_move_to_label` — bulk move to label with progress notifications
- `bulk_move_emails` — bulk move with progress notifications
- `bulk_delete_emails` — bulk delete with progress notifications
- `request_permission_escalation` — agent requests temporary elevated permissions
- `check_escalation_status` — poll pending escalation status
- `sync_folders` — refresh folder list from IMAP server

### Changed
- Tool descriptions rewritten for agent token efficiency (no emojis)
- All tool responses now include `structuredContent` + `outputSchema`
- Config stored in `~/.protonmail-mcp.json` with mode 0600 and atomic writes
- `add_label` renamed to `move_to_label` for accurate semantics

### Security
- 10-layer defense-in-depth security model
- CSRF protection on all mutating settings API calls
- Origin/Referer validation on settings server
- Input sanitization (email addresses, folder names, attachment sizes, hostnames)
- CRLF injection prevention in SMTP headers
- Email cache capped at 500 entries, rate-limiter buckets capped at 10k
- Append-only audit log at `~/.protonmail-mcp.audit.jsonl`
