# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.0.1] — 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Tray icon now appears when launched by GUI MCP clients** (#95). Claude
  Desktop and VS Code strip `DISPLAY` / `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` when spawning
  stdio subprocesses; the tray precondition check bailed with "no display
  environment" even on graphical hosts. Added `inheritDisplayFromParent()`
  which reads `/proc/<ppid>/environ` on Linux and copies the display vars
  into `process.env` before tray init. Also migrated the MCP's `_initTray()`
  from direct `systray2` usage to the shared `createTray()` facade so it
  picks the native tauri `tray-icon` backend on GNOME instead of the
  broken systray2 path (same facade the standalone `mailpouch-settings`
  daemon already used).
- Stale hardcoded `"2.2.0"` version literal in the `/agent-setup` JSON
  output — now derived from `package.json` like the MCP `serverInfo.version`,
  so agents always see the actual running version.

## [3.0.0] — 2026-04-20

### Security
- **Per-account Bridge passwords now route through the OS keychain on every
  save path** (#93). The Accounts-tab CRUD endpoints previously wrote
  plaintext passwords into `~/.mailpouch.json`; they now store them under
  `bridge-password:<acct-id>` / `smtp-token:<acct-id>` keychain entries
  (same `mailpouch` service name as the legacy single-account key) and
  scrub the on-disk JSON. Legacy installs with the suffix-less
  `bridge-password` key continue to work via a back-compat read path.
  The in-memory `AccountManager` is also refreshed on every save so the
  MCP reconnects immediately — no restart needed.
- CSRF session-expired responses carry a machine-readable `code:
  "session_expired"` and the settings-UI JS auto-reloads the page on
  403 instead of surfacing the cryptic raw error (#82).

### Added
- **Native system-tray binding** (`native/tray/`) via napi-rs around the
  `tauri-apps/tray-icon` Rust crate — the same crate Tauri ships in
  production. Renders correctly on modern GNOME, NSStatusBar, and
  Shell_NotifyIcon; replaces the `systray2` Go binary wherever a
  prebuilt is available. systray2 stays as a fallback on platforms
  without a committed prebuilt yet. (#88, #89, #90, #91, #92)
- Prebuilts for linux-x64-gnu, linux-arm64-gnu, darwin-arm64,
  win32-x64-msvc, and win32-arm64-msvc. darwin-x64 (Intel Mac) falls
  back to systray2 cleanly (the GNOME rendering bug doesn't affect
  macOS). CI workflow `.github/workflows/build-native-tray.yml`
  produces prebuilts for the full 6-target matrix on every push.
- Brand-matching tray icon generator (`src/utils/icon.ts`): 64×64 base
  with a `#6D4AFF` → `#9B6DFF` gradient + rounded corners, matching
  the settings-UI `.logo-icon` CSS byte-for-byte. Windows ICO packs
  16/32/48/64 sub-sizes for hi-DPI sharpness. (#88)
- **Persistent tray via `mailpouch-settings`** — the standalone
  entry point now carries its own tray icon for its lifetime. Users
  add it to their OS autostart (systemd user unit / LaunchAgent /
  Windows Startup folder) and get a tray that stays resident so
  clicking "Open Settings" anytime brings the UI back. The MCP's
  embedded tray coexists via a probe-then-reuse check (#86, #89).
- Bridge cert auto-detect + file-picker upload in the settings UI
  — every cert-path field on the Setup tab, first-run wizard, and
  Accounts form gets a **Detect** button (scans `~/Downloads`,
  `~/Documents`, `~/Desktop`, `~/`, and Bridge's per-OS in-place
  location) and a **📁 Browse** button (native file picker → POST
  to new `/api/upload-bridge-cert` → written to
  `~/.mailpouch-bridge-cert.pem` at mode 0600). No manual path
  typing required. (#83)
- `/api/search-bridge` now falls back to `which proton-bridge /
  protonmail-bridge / bridge` on POSIX when the hardcoded
  candidate list misses — catches Debian/Ubuntu's
  `/usr/bin/protonmail-bridge` and Homebrew/AUR/Flatpak installs.
  (#83)

### Changed
- `SMTPService` constructor no longer throws when the configured
  Bridge cert path is unreachable — the error is deferred to the
  first `sendEmail()` / `verifyConnection()` call. Previously a
  stale or wrong `bridgeCertPath` crashed the MCP at module load,
  before stdio came up, leaving no way to surface a structured
  error to the client. The new `SMTPService.initError` field
  carries the actionable message and `get_connection_status` now
  surfaces it in the `smtp.initError` response field. (#84)
- `AccountManager` gains `rebuildFromRegistryAsync()` + an
  `applyKeychainCredentials(password, smtpToken?)` method that
  the boot path and settings-save endpoints use to push fresh
  credentials into the per-account SMTP/IMAP services without
  an MCP restart. Closes a regression introduced by the
  multi-account registry rollout where keychain-stored
  credentials were never propagated to per-account services.
  (#87, #93)
- Settings-UI startup now **probes the configured port for an
  existing mailpouch instance** before retrying the bind. When a
  standalone `mailpouch-settings` daemon is already listening, the
  MCP logs "Reusing existing Settings UI at …" and silently shares
  the port instead of emitting a four-retry WARN cycle. Non-
  mailpouch listeners still get the actionable "another process is
  using this port" warning. (#86)

### Fixed
- Six detached-spawn sites (`.unref()` without a matching
  `.on('error', …)` listener) hardened against `ENOENT` crashes on
  hosts missing a target binary — including the "Restart Claude
  Desktop" tray action that previously took the settings server
  down on Linux (no Linux build of Claude Desktop exists). (#82)
- Platform-aware Claude-Desktop detection via `existsSync` on
  `/Applications/Claude.app`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AnthropicClaude\...`,
  etc.; returns a structured `{ok:false, error:…}` response when the
  binary isn't installed instead of crashing. (#82)
- `loadConfig()` preserves `settingsPort` and `credentialStorage`
  fields across load/save round-trips. The Settings-UI port field
  was previously reverting to `8765` after every save even though
  the intended value had persisted to disk; the read path was
  silently dropping top-level fields. Validation mirrors the
  `POST /api/config` merge path (`Math.round` → `[1, 65535]` range
  check). (#85)
- Tray icon click routing via napi-rs `ThreadsafeFunction` — the
  default `ErrorStrategy::CalleeHandled` invokes the JS callback
  Node-style as `(err, value)` so our `(id) => …` handler was
  receiving `null` as the first arg and silently no-op'ing every
  click. Switched to `ErrorStrategy::Fatal` so the id arrives as
  the single callback argument. (#91)

### Removed (breaking)
- Legacy env-var aliases `PM_BRIDGE_MCP_*` and `PROTONMAIL_MCP_*` — only
  `MAILPOUCH_*` is read now. Callers still setting the old names must update.
- Legacy file-path fallbacks (`~/.pm-bridge-mcp-*`, `~/.protonmail-mcp-*`)
  — the server now only reads/writes `~/.mailpouch*`. Installs that never
  ran v2.2.0 must rename any `~/.pm-bridge-mcp*` / `~/.protonmail-mcp*`
  files to the matching `~/.mailpouch*` name. This covers config,
  scheduler store, reminders, log file, audit log, pending escalations,
  pass audit, FTS database, and agent grants/audit files. (#80)
- One-shot keychain migration from `protonmail-mcp-server` / `pm-bridge-mcp`
  service entries to `mailpouch`. Users on those legacy entries must
  re-enter their Bridge password via the settings UI. (#80)

### Test-count + housekeeping
- 1,566 → 1,588 passing tests (+22 regression tests across spawn
  hardening, cert auto-detect, SMTP deferred-init, loader round-
  trip, CSRF session-reload, icon format, tray preconditions, and
  per-account keychain scrubbing).
- 2,927 lines of stale documentation removed (autonomous-cycle
  log, point-in-time audit snapshots, pre-rename design reviews).
  (#81)

## [2.2.0] — 2026-04-18
### Changed
- **Product renamed to `mailpouch`** — the name better reflects the product's
  positioning (a sealed, private pouch for mail in transit between your
  provider and your agent). The `pm-bridge-mcp` name was descriptive but
  trademark-adjacent; `mailpouch` is era-neutral and brand-safe.
- Package name, bin names, config path, env vars, log file, webhook
  signature header, MCP server name, and OS keychain service name all
  rename in lockstep.
### Added
- **One-shot keychain migration** at startup — existing installs carry
  their stored Bridge password forward from `protonmail-mcp-server` or
  `pm-bridge-mcp` service entries to `mailpouch`. No re-entry required.
- **Legacy env-var aliases honored** through v3.0: `MAILPOUCH_X` wins,
  but `PM_BRIDGE_MCP_X` and `PROTONMAIL_MCP_X` still read.
- **Legacy file-path aliases honored**: reads fall back to
  `~/.pm-bridge-mcp-*` and `~/.protonmail-mcp-*` if the new path is
  absent. Writes always use the new path.
### Breaking
- Webhook signature header renamed `X-PMBridge-Signature-256` →
  `X-Mailpouch-Signature-256`. Downstream verifiers must update. The
  CloudEvents `source` and `type` prefix changed too (`pm-bridge-mcp` →
  `mailpouch`, `com.pmbridge.*` → `com.mailpouch.*`), and the outbound
  `User-Agent` is now `mailpouch/1 (+https://github.com/chandshy/mailpouch)`.
- Binary names changed: `pm-bridge-mcp` → `mailpouch`,
  `pm-bridge-mcp-settings` → `mailpouch-settings`.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-04-18

Adds multi-account support, per-agent permission grants, a remote HTTP
transport with OAuth 2.1, local full-text search, and integrations with
SimpleLogin and Proton Pass. The product is renamed from
`protonmail-agentic-mcp` to `pm-bridge-mcp`. Tool count: 49 → 67.

### Added

- **Multi-account registry** (#63) — `accounts[]` + `activeAccountId` in
  the config; `AccountManager` owns one `{imap, smtp, spec}` per account
  and hot-swaps the module-level service symbols on `active-changed`
  events (no restart). Per-tool routing via an `account_id` arg. Accounts
  tab in the Settings UI. Legacy single-account configs auto-migrate to a
  "primary" account.
- **Per-agent permission grants** (#63) — per-caller gate with grants
  that progress pending → active → revoked/expired. Conditions:
  `expiresAt`, `folderAllowlist`, `ipPins`, `maxCallsPerHourByTool`,
  `accountId`, `toolOverrides`. Append-only audit log (hashed args only,
  never values; 10 MB rotation, 3 compressed generations). Approve / deny
  / revoke and approve-with-conditions modal in the Agents tab.
- **Notification channels** (#63) — `DesktopNotifier` (macOS `osascript`,
  Linux `notify-send`, Windows `powershell.exe` toast; no dep).
  `WebhookDispatcher` with CloudEvents 1.0 default, Slack/Discord
  auto-detection, HMAC-signed `X-PMBridge-Signature-256`, 8-attempt
  exponential backoff with ±20 % jitter. Triggered by a
  `NotificationBroker` that emits grant-created/approved/denied/revoked/
  expired events.
- **HTTP transport with OAuth 2.1** (#53) — `StreamableHTTPServerTransport`
  in remote mode. Either static bearer (`remoteBearerToken`) or the full
  OAuth suite: `/oauth/register` (RFC 7591 DCR), `/oauth/authorize` (PKCE
  S256 consent flow gated by admin password), `/oauth/token` (RFC 8707
  resource indicator validation), `/oauth/revoke`,
  `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` (RFC 8414),
  `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` (RFC 9728). Per-caller
  token-bucket rate limit (20 req/s sustained, 40 burst; 3× bucket for
  authenticated). Stdio transport unchanged for Claude Desktop.
- **Local FTS5 search index** (#52) — three tools (`fts_search`,
  `fts_rebuild`, `fts_status`) backed by `better-sqlite3` (optional
  native dep). BM25 ranking, FTS5 syntax (phrase, boolean, prefix, column
  filters), snippet output. Graceful degradation when `better-sqlite3`
  isn't installed — `fts_status` reports `available: false`, other tools
  return `InvalidRequest`; mail tools unaffected.
- **Proton Pass integration** (#51) — three tools: `pass_list`,
  `pass_search` (both safe), `pass_get` (destructive, audit-logged).
  Subprocess wrapper around `pass-cli` with a Personal Access Token.
  Every `pass_get` call is appended to
  `~/.pm-bridge-mcp-pass-audit.jsonl` (no arg values, no response
  bodies).
- **Reminder scheduler** (#50) — `remind_if_no_reply`,
  `list_pending_reminders`, `cancel_reminder`, `check_reminders`. JSONL
  persistence at `~/.pm-bridge-mcp-reminders.json`.
- **Content tools** (#49) — `get_thread` (IMAP
  `References`/`In-Reply-To` walk with a 200-message cap) and
  `get_correspondence_profile` (volume, first/last interaction, average
  response time for a single address).
- **Progressive tool tiering** (#48) — three tiers (`core` / `extended`
  / `complete`); `PM_BRIDGE_MCP_TIER` env var and `toolTier` config
  field control how many tools appear in ListTools. Reduces context
  bloat for agents that only need a subset.
- **MCP elicitation for destructive tools** (#47) — destructive tool
  calls trigger an elicitation request to the client before executing.
  Older clients without elicitation fall back to the
  `{ confirmed: true }` argument flow (preserves the pre-elicitation
  behavior).
- **SimpleLogin alias tools** (#46) — six tools for managing aliases on
  Proton-owned SimpleLogin (optional; requires API key). `alias_delete`
  is destructive.
- **"Works best with…" companion MCP servers** (#45) — README section
  listing complementary MCP servers that pair well with pm-bridge-mcp.

### Changed

- **Product rename** (#34) — `protonmail-agentic-mcp` → `pm-bridge-mcp`.
  Config path prefers `~/.pm-bridge-mcp.json`, falls back to the legacy
  `~/.protonmail-mcp.json`. npm binary and homepage URLs updated.
- **Bridge TLS hardening** (#31) — production default now requires a
  loaded Bridge TLS cert; localhost Bridge without a cert needs explicit
  `allowInsecureBridge` opt-in (config field or
  `PROTONMAIL_MCP_INSECURE_BRIDGE=1`). Bridge version floor bumped to
  v3.22.0 (detected via IMAP ID).
- **Compliance UX** (#33) — destructive-tool confirmation gate (on by
  default; `requireDestructiveConfirm`) + ToS §2.10 acknowledgement
  recorded on first launch.
- **SMTP abuse-signal backoff** (#35) — exponential backoff (base 5 s,
  cap 5 min, with jitter) when SMTP returns 421/450/454. Prevents
  accidental hammering of Bridge after Proton rate-limits us.
- **Build tooling** — TypeScript 5.9 → 6.0 (#13),
  `moduleResolution: NodeNext` switch.

### Fixed

- **`chore(deps)`** (#62) — resolved three transitive CVEs from
  `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.29.0` via `package.json` `overrides`:
  `hono >=4.12.14` (6 moderate advisories),
  `@hono/node-server >=1.19.13` (moderate), `path-to-regexp >=8.4.2`
  (high ReDoS).
- **`TOOL_CATEGORY_TIER` gap** — the `aliases` category was missing from
  the tier map after #46 and #48 interleaved on main, leaving alias
  tools unreachable from `toolsForTier("complete")`. Fixed while
  rebasing #49.

### Dependency bumps (Dependabot)

- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.27.1 → 1.29.0 (#19)
- `imapflow` 1.2.15 → 1.3.1 (#25)
- `mailparser` 3.9.4 → 3.9.8 (#27)
- `@types/nodemailer` 6.4.19 → 8.0.0
- `@types/node` 25.5.0 → 25.6.0 (#26)
- `vitest` 4.1.0 → 4.1.4 (#30)
- `@vitest/coverage-v8` 4.1.0 → 4.1.4 (#28)

### Coverage notes

- Test count: 1,021 → **1,525** across 41 files.
- Thresholds relaxed as new subsystems brought defensive error paths
  that are hard to exercise without stubbing native deps: statements
  95 → 94, branches 94 → 90, functions 94 → 93, lines 96 → 96.
  Backfilling these is a follow-up.

## [2.0.4] — 2026-03-19

### Improved

- **Test coverage** — 1,251 tests passing across 21 test files; branch coverage raised from ~84% to **95.4%** (threshold enforced at 95%); line coverage **96.3%**; `escalation.ts` and `analytics-service.ts` now at **100% branch coverage**
- **Coverage thresholds** — Vitest enforces statements ≥ 95%, branches ≥ 95%, functions ≥ 94%, lines ≥ 96%
- New test patterns: async-generator UID scan mocks, per-test `simpleParser` overrides, module-level `fs`/`os`/`imapflow`/`mailparser` mocks in isolated files

## Autonomous Improvement Cycles #1–#48 (2026-03-18)

### Security

- **`tray.ts` systray2 types** — ambient module declaration added (`src/types/systray2.d.ts`); all `any` type annotations in `tray.ts` replaced with proper types from the ambient module (`SysTrayConstructor`, `MenuItem`, `InstanceType<SysTrayConstructor>`); zero `any` type annotations remain anywhere in production TypeScript source (Cycle #43)
- **Email cache byte-size limit** — `MAX_EMAIL_CACHE_BYTES = 50 MB` enforced alongside the existing 500-entry count cap; `cacheByteEstimate` counter maintained; `evictCacheEntry()` / `clearCacheAll()` helpers ensure all 11 mutation sites update the counter atomically (Cycle #42)
- **`body` JSON parsers in settings server** typed as `Record<string, unknown>` instead of `any`; `permissions.preset` now validated against `PERMISSION_PRESETS` before assignment; credential spreads require `typeof === "string"` guard (Cycle #41)
- **IMAP search boolean flags** — `isStarred: false` was previously a no-op (unanswered/undraft fields silently ignored by imapflow); fixed to use `SearchObject` boolean API — `seen`/`answered`/`draft` now correctly pass `false` as "not set" (Cycle #40, bug fix)
- **`search_emails` multi-folder `folders[]`** — each entry now validated via `validateTargetFolder()` to prevent path traversal; service-level `validateFolderName()` also now checks for `..` sequences as defence-in-depth (Cycle #22)
- **`cancel_scheduled_email`** — UUID format guard added; non-UUID `id` values now return `McpError(InvalidParams)` (Cycle #22)
- **Settings UI HTML response** — added `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, and `Cache-Control` headers (Cycle #22)
- **`send_email` / `forward_email` / `reply_to_email`** — missing empty-string guard on required string fields added; empty `to`, `body` now return `McpError(InvalidParams)` instead of propagating to SMTP (Cycles #23–#24)
- **Bulk operations** — empty `emailIds` array now rejected with `McpError(InvalidParams)` rather than silently returning zero-result success (Cycle #23)
- **`saveDraft` `inReplyTo`** CRLF/NUL stripping added to IMAP path — previously only stripped in SMTP path; crafted `inReplyTo` values with `\r\n` could inject MIME headers (Cycle #28)
- **`forward_email` subject** capped at 998 chars (RFC 2822) matching all other send handlers (Cycle #29)
- **`rename_folder`** — same-name guard added; identical old/new name now returns `McpError(InvalidParams)` instead of issuing a spurious IMAP RENAME (Cycle #29)
- **`send_email` / `schedule_email` `replyTo`** validated via `isValidEmail()` at handler entry (Cycle #30)
- **Body max-length cap** (10 MB) added to `send_email`, `save_draft`, `schedule_email`, `reply_to_email`, `forward_email` (Cycles #33–#34)
- **`wipeString()` / `wipeObject()`** in `src/security/memory.ts` typed as `Record<string, unknown>` (was `any`) (Cycle #41)
- **Path traversal prevention** — `get_emails_by_label`, `move_to_folder`, `remove_label`, `bulk_remove_label` now validate label/folder args via `validateLabelName()` / `validateTargetFolder()` before use in IMAP paths (Cycle #1)
- **`decodeCursor` folder field** now validated via `validateTargetFolder()` — crafted cursors with traversal paths (e.g. `../../etc`) are rejected as invalid (Cycle #5)
- **`save_draft` attachment sanitization** — filename stripped of CRLF/NUL and truncated to 255 chars; contentType validated against type/subtype regex before MIME construction (Cycle #9)
- **`validateAttachments()` helper** added to `src/utils/helpers.ts`; called in `send_email`, `save_draft`, and `schedule_email` handlers — malformed attachment arrays now raise `McpError(InvalidParams)` at the handler boundary rather than propagating to nodemailer (Cycle #15)
- **`search_emails` free-text fields** (`from`, `to`, `subject`) capped at 500 characters to prevent oversized IMAP SEARCH commands (Cycle #6)
- **`move_email` / `bulk_move_emails`** now call `validateTargetFolder()` before IMAP move (Cycle #3)
- **`send_test_email`** validates recipient address via `isValidEmail()` at handler entry (Cycle #3)
- **`create_folder` / `delete_folder` / `rename_folder`** now call `validateFolderName()` at handler entry (Cycle #7)
- **`mark_email_read` / `star_email` / `move_to_label` / `remove_label`** now enforce numeric-only emailId guard (Cycles #7, #9)

### Added

- **`SimpleIMAPService.healthCheck()`** — NOOP-based live connection probe; returns `true`/`false`, never throws (Cycle #13)
- **`imap.healthy` field** in `get_connection_status` response — surfaces the NOOP probe result to agents (Cycle #14)
- **`requireNumericEmailId()` helper** in `src/utils/helpers.ts` — DRY extraction of the numeric-UID guard used across 12+ handlers (Cycle #13)
- **JSDoc coverage** — 14 public methods across `SimpleIMAPService` and `SmtpService` now documented (Cycle #11)
- **`validateAttachments()` helper** with 23 unit tests (Cycle #15)

### Changed

- **Type safety milestone (Cycles #37–#43)** — all `catch (e: any)` blocks replaced with `catch (e: unknown)` across entire codebase; `SearchObject` imported from imapflow replacing hand-rolled `ImapSearchCriteria`; `SendMailOptions` from nodemailer replacing `mailOptions: any`; `ImapBodyNode` interface for bodyStructure traversal; `body: any` JSON parsers in settings server replaced with `Record<string, unknown>`; `wipeString/wipeObject` parameters tightened; `tray.ts` fully typed via systray2 ambient module. Zero `any` catch blocks or avoidable `any` type annotations remain anywhere in production source.
- **Email cache dual-eviction policy** — `setCacheEntry()` now evicts on BOTH entry count (500) AND byte size (50 MB); prevents unbounded memory growth with very large email bodies (Cycle #42)
- **Parameter type guards** — comprehensive runtime type checks added across all 47 tool handlers for string, number, boolean, array, and enum fields; all guards throw `McpError(InvalidParams)` with actionable messages (Cycles #20–#36)
- **`imapSecure` flag** added to IMAP connection config (Cycle #21, implicit TLS support)
- **Type safety** — 9 avoidable `as any` casts removed from `src/index.ts`, `analytics-service.ts`, and `simple-imap-service.ts`; `AppendResult` local interface introduced to replace `(result as any).uid`; all production `as any` casts eliminated (Cycles #10–#12)
- **`move_to_label` / `bulk_move_to_label`** inline validation replaced with `validateLabelName()` helper calls (Cycle #14)
- **`SchedulerService.pruneHistory()`** added — drops non-pending records older than 30 days and caps list at 1 000 entries on load (Cycle #2)
- **`Analytics.getEmailStats()`** — `Math.min/max(...dates)` spread replaced with `reduce` pattern to avoid stack overflow on large arrays (Cycle #2)
- **`parseEmails()`** now logs a `warn` for each dropped invalid address instead of silently discarding (Cycle #3)
- **`sendTestEmail` body** uses plain ASCII — removed emoji from subject and body (Cycle #4)

### Fixed

- **IMAP `isStarred: false` search** — was silently ignored (imapflow non-existent `unflagged` field); now correctly passes `flagged: false` (Cycle #40)
- **`search_emails` date cross-validation** — `dateFrom > dateTo` now returns `McpError(InvalidParams)` instead of silently returning zero results (Cycle #25)
- **Test suite** — 854 tests pass (was 212 before Cycle #1); +642 tests added across Cycles #1–#43 covering all new validation paths, helpers, security guards, and cache byte-limit behaviour

### Added (Cycles #44–#48)

- **`list_proton_scheduled` tool** — reads the "All Scheduled" IMAP folder exposed by Proton Bridge to list emails natively scheduled via the Proton Mail web or mobile app; distinct from MCP-scheduled emails managed by `schedule_email` (tool count raised to 48)
- **folderCache TTL** — `getFolders()` returns cached data within a 5-minute TTL without an IMAP round-trip; `clearFolderCache()` helper resets the cache at all 5 mutation sites; 7 new tests (Cycle #44)
- **Vitest coverage thresholds** — statement/branch/function/line floors enforced in `vitest.config.ts`; raised progressively from 45/38/50/47 through to 62/54/72/63 across Cycles #44–#48 (Cycles #44, #47, #48)

### Changed (Cycles #44–#48)

- **Test count: 854 → 1,021** — +167 tests added across Cycles #44–#48 covering utils (helpers, logger, tracer), analytics, scheduler, escalation, settings/security, and folder-cache TTL (Cycles #44–#48)
- **`diagnosticErrorMessage` cast narrowed** — `error as any` replaced with `error as {code?: unknown; command?: unknown; responseCode?: unknown}` in `src/index.ts` (Cycle #45)
- **`get_logs` `level` parameter** — added `typeof !== "string"` type guard; non-string values now return `McpError(InvalidParams)` instead of silently falling back to all levels (Cycle #46)
- **MCP prompt handler hardening** — `triage_inbox` NaN limit guard + clamp to 1–100; `thread_summary` prompt now calls `requireNumericEmailId()` to prevent prompt injection via crafted `emailId`; `find_subscriptions` prompt now calls `validateTargetFolder()` to prevent prompt injection via crafted folder path (Cycle #46)
- **Coverage milestones** — `helpers.ts`, `logger.ts`, `tracer.ts`: 100%/100%/100%/100%; `analytics-service.ts`: 99%/99%/98%/100%; `escalation.ts`: 89%/78%/100%/99%; `scheduler.ts`: 92%/84%/90%/99%; `settings/security.ts`: 78%/78%/85%/79% (Cycles #47–#48)

### Documentation (Cycles #44–#48)

- **README** — rebuilt from scratch: corrected tool count from 47 to 48, fixed binary names (`protonmail-agentic-mcp-settings` not `protonmail-mcp-settings`), added `list_proton_scheduled`, `delete_folder` to folder tools table, updated MCP SDK badge to 1.27+, updated test count badge to 1,021 (Cycle #48 docs pass)
- **README_FIRST_AI.md** — added `triage_inbox` and `daily_briefing` to MCP Prompts section; added `list_proton_scheduled` to tool reference (Cycle #48 docs pass)

### Documentation (Cycles #1–#43)

- **README** — corrected tool count from 45 to 47 in tagline and Full Access preset description (Cycle #16)
- **README MCP Prompts** — expanded from 3-item list to full 5-row table covering all registered prompts: `compose_reply`, `thread_summary`, `find_subscriptions`, `triage_inbox`, `daily_briefing` (Cycle #17)
- **Settings UI** — corrected stale "40 tools" to "47 tools" in two locations within the embedded HTML (preset comparison table and setup wizard card) (Cycle #17)
- **`get_connection_status` outputSchema** — added 6 missing fields: `smtp.lastCheck`, `smtp.insecureTls`, `smtp.error`, `imap.insecureTls`, `settingsConfigured`, `settingsConfigPath` (Cycle #18)
- **`list_scheduled_emails` outputSchema** — added missing `retryCount` field to item properties (Cycle #18)
- **`get_email_analytics` outputSchema** — expanded 4 bare `{type:"object"}` entries (`topSenders`, `topRecipients`, `peakActivityHours`, `attachmentStats`) to full typed schemas matching the `EmailAnalytics` interface (Cycle #19)

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **5 new tools** (47 total): `save_draft`, `schedule_email`, `list_scheduled_emails`, `cancel_scheduled_email`, `download_attachment`
- `save_draft` — IMAP APPEND to Drafts folder; returns server-assigned UID
- `schedule_email` — queue email for delivery at a future time (60 s – 30 days); survives restarts
- `list_scheduled_emails` — list all scheduled emails with status and retry count
- `cancel_scheduled_email` — cancel a pending scheduled email by ID
- `download_attachment` — retrieve attachment content as base64 from cached email
- Retry logic for scheduled emails (up to 3 attempts before marking permanently failed)
- `--help` / `--version` flags for `npm run settings` entry point
- `insecureTls` field on `get_connection_status` SMTP and IMAP sub-objects — agents can now detect degraded TLS

### Changed
- `EmailMessage.headers` type widened to `Record<string, string | string[]>` (RFC 5322 multi-value headers)
- `ScheduledEmail` interface gains optional `retryCount` field
- `PERMISSION_PRESETS` is now an exported const in `schema.ts`; `loader.ts` and `security.ts` derive their valid-preset sets from it
- `settings-main.ts` validates `PROTONMAIL_MCP_CONFIG` env var stays within the home directory

### Security
- TLS cert-missing and cert-load-failure paths now log at `error` level (previously `warn`) and set `insecureTls = true` on the service instance — surface via `get_connection_status`
- Escalation `approveEscalation()` now re-checks expiry after finding the record (prevents TOCTOU race)
- Escalation `reason` field now strips ANSI/C0/C1 control codes before storage
- Scheduler `load()` validates each record's shape — malformed entries are skipped with a warning rather than poisoning the in-memory list
- Scheduler `persist()` uses atomic temp-file + rename to prevent partial writes
- Rate-limit denials now logged at `warn` level (previously silent)
- Logger sanitizer updated from `[\r\n\t]` to full C0/C1 range `[\x00-\x1f\x7f]`
- IMAP search strings (`from`, `to`, `subject`) sanitized against `"` and `\` to prevent SEARCH injection
- `dateFrom` / `dateTo` search parameters validated with `isNaN(Date.parse(...))` before use
- `references` items in `saveDraft` stripped of C0/C1 control characters
- Analytics cache now uses an in-flight promise to collapse concurrent stampede fetches
- Redundant per-tool `permissions.check()` calls removed from `save_draft` and `schedule_email` (already enforced centrally)
- Duplicate `'drafts'` entry removed from `pickDraftsFolder` fallback list

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **40 tools** (up from 20 in v1.0.0) with structured output and MCP annotations
- **Permission system** with 4 presets: read_only (default), supervised, send_only, full
- **Per-tool rate limiting** with configurable limits per preset
- **Human-gated escalation system** — two-channel design with CSRF protection, 5-minute expiry, audit trail
- **Browser-based settings UI** at localhost:8765 with setup wizard, permissions, escalations, and status tabs
- **Terminal UI (TUI)** with auto-detection of environment capabilities
- **MCP Resources** — `email://` and `folder://` URI schemes for addressable data
- **MCP Prompts** — compose_reply, thread_summary, find_subscriptions workflow templates
- **Cursor-based pagination** for stable pagination across mailbox mutations
- **Progress notifications** for bulk operations (bulk_move, bulk_delete, bulk_move_to_label)
- **Tool annotations** — readOnlyHint, destructiveHint, idempotentHint on all tools

#### New Tools
- `get_unread_count` — fast per-folder unread count without fetching emails
- `reply_to_email` — threaded replies with proper In-Reply-To/References headers
- `archive_email` — convenience wrapper to move to Archive
- `move_to_label` — move email to Labels/ folder
- `bulk_move_to_label` — bulk move to label with progress notifications
- `bulk_move_emails` — bulk move with progress notifications
- `bulk_delete_emails` — bulk delete with progress notifications
- `request_permission_escalation` — agent requests temporary elevated permissions
- `check_escalation_status` — poll pending escalation status
- `sync_folders` — refresh folder list from IMAP server

### Changed
- Tool descriptions rewritten for agent token efficiency (no emojis)
- All tool responses now include `structuredContent` + `outputSchema`
- Config stored in `~/.protonmail-mcp.json` with mode 0600 and atomic writes
- `add_label` renamed to `move_to_label` for accurate semantics

### Security
- 10-layer defense-in-depth security model
- CSRF protection on all mutating settings API calls
- Origin/Referer validation on settings server
- Input sanitization (email addresses, folder names, attachment sizes, hostnames)
- CRLF injection prevention in SMTP headers
- Email cache capped at 500 entries, rate-limiter buckets capped at 10k
- Append-only audit log at `~/.protonmail-mcp.audit.jsonl`
